The hardware is based on Arduino Mega with display and Ramps 1.4 Board. Ramps 1.6 and similar boards will work, too.


# Modifications
- Add a 100nF C between S and GND for the X and Y limit switches

- Add a 100nF C between D63 and GND for the e-stopp button

- Optional: When using a back button connect the button, by soldering wires parallel to the stop button on the display, otherwise the stop button on the display operates as back button
